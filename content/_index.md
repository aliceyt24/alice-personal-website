Hello! My name is Alice and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Education at the University of California, Berkeley.
My dissertation focuses on the unprecedented rise of youth movements in Brazil, so in addition to my home-base in Berkeley, I spend some of my time in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
For a longer biography, please see [here](/biography).

Feel free to look around and if anything catches your eye, or you think we could work together, please get in touch!
