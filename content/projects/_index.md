I am working on several co-authored writing projects and grateful to write with SWAG, a writing group with the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues


I'm engaged in the Comparative & International Education Society (CIES), American Educational Research Association (AERA), and other societies as well as research groups at UC Berkeley and Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro on digital methods, social movements (NETS) and anti-racist education (Gepear)


I have also worked on research consultancies related to gender and gender-based violence



The other kind of movement I love is dance, so you can also find me in contemporary dance communities!
