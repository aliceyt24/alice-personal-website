Collaborations, community engaged work, and reflexivity about my positionality, are central to what I do and to more meaningful work in the long term. 

I was a graduate affiliate of the UC Berkeley Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and have participated for over five years in a writing group with the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues. I'm working on several co-authored writing projects.

I'm engaged in several activist movements and organize in the U.S. and Brazil, and participated in the Learning Community for Graduate Scholar-Activists through the UC Berkeley American Cultures Program and a recent AERA Scholar-Activist preconference workshop. While at UC Berkeley and with other students, I organized to promote shifts the climate of the department. I was active in the largest strike in US higher education history that occurred across the University of California (UC) system in 2022, involving about 48,000 academic workers. We fought for better conditions for student workers including graduate student instructors and researchers, through the UAW-2865 (union). 

I have been an organizer and created several panels with the Comparative & International Education Society (CIES), primarily 21st Century Alternatives: Global Alternatives to Patriarchy, Racial Capitalism, Militarism, and Climate Change track since 2018 and The Alternatives Project (TAP) with educators committed to designing, implementing, and partnering to develop transformative, socially just education in and outside of formal settings. For CIES 2024, we co-organized around the theme, "the Power of Protest" with educators and activist-allies and a march for Florida Educators. In 2025 we organized another action and press conference in Denver, CO to protect K-12 and Higher Education, with local and national speakers. 

I have also presented at the American Sociological Association (ASA), Latin American Studies Association (LASA), American Educational Research Association (AERA), and other conferences and community fora. I participated in research groups at UC Berkeley and the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro on digital methods, social movements (NETS) and anti-racist education (Gepear).

For about 10 years, I worked as a researcher and  consultant on projects about gender and gender-based violence, education, and youth with several organizations including Action Aid; Promundo (now Equimundo); UN entities such as UN-Habitat and UNFPA; and The Feinstein International Center at Tufts University. 

Here are a few examples of scholar-activist events I have co-organized:

The other kind of movement I love is dance, so you can also find me in contemporary dance communities!
