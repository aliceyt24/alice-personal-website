I am working on several co-authored writing projects and grateful to write with SWAG, a writing group with the Institute for the Study of Societal Issues
I'm engaged in several activist movements.

I have been a track organizer and created several panels with the Comparative & International Education Society (CIES), and presented at the American Educational Research Association (AERA), and other conferences/societies. I participate in research groups at UC Berkeley and the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro on digital methods, social movements (NETS) and anti-racist education (Gepear)

I have also worked on research consultancies related to gender and gender-based violence.

The other kind of movement I love is dance, so you can also find me in contemporary dance communities!
