I am a Global Justice postdoctoral scholar at University of Denver's Korbel School of International Affairs. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley School of Education in 2023. An interdisciplinary social scientist and ethnographer, I study education and social movements including youth political and civic engagement; sociocultural approaches to language, literacies, and learning across in-person and digital spaces; and interconnections between local and global structures of oppression and resistance. My work is driven by commitments to social justice, community engagement, and the transformative and humanizing possibilities of education in and especially outside of schools. It has been published in several journals including Ethnography & Education and with co-authors in Comparative Education Review, as well as in public scholarship.

A central question that has motivated my work over time is understanding how people come together to envision and enact social change. My dissertation examined the unprecedented rise of youth movements in Brazil and was supported by grants and fellowships including the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad. It focused on how youth interconnect, or articulate, plural struggles in movements for a society that is anti-capitalist, anti-racist, feminist, and promotes LGBTQI rights and climate justice. I find that in doing so, youth are also (re)creating forms of collective action, education in multimodal and hybrid spaces, and democracy amidst a polarized society.

I lived in Brazil for seven years (I’m originally from the U.S.) and lived and worked in the U.S., Latin America, and Africa. Since I was a middle schooler, I’ve spent most of my time in Latin America and the U.S., so I speak Portuguese and Spanish. I love collaborating to design qualitative research, especially with youth, teaching it, figuring out ways to make it meaningful and impactful, and critiquing it. Since 2002 I have been engaged in research projects about inequalities and resistance related to education, gender, and (non-)violence. I focused on addressing disparities in education and health, interconnections between gender-based violence and urban violence, marriage during childhood and adolescence, and how violence early in life, especially non-physical forms of violence, can shape youth and adult experiences. 

While at UC Berkeley, I was a graduate affiliate of the Center for Latin American Studies at UC Berkeley and pursued a designated emphasis in Gender & Women's Studies.
