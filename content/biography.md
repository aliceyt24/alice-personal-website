I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley School of Education. I study youth identity formation and political development; learning and literacies across in-person and digital spaces; and interconnections between local and global structures of oppression and resistance. 


An interdisciplinary social scientist and ethnographer, my research interests are in international and comparative education; civic engagement; the study of education and social movements; and critical and sociological perspectives of gender, race, class, and place. 


I lived in Brazil for seven years (I’m originally from the U.S.) and lived and worked in the U.S., Latin America, and Africa. Since I was a middle schooler, I’ve spent most of my time in Latin America and the U.S., so I speak Portuguese and Spanish. I love collaborating to design qualitative research, especially with youth, teaching it, figuring out ways to make it meaningful, and critiquing it. Since 2002 I have in some way or another been engaged in research projects about inequalities and resistance related to education, gender, and (non-)violence. I focused on understanding interconnections between gender-based violence and urban violence, marriage during childhood and adolescence, and how violence early in life, especially non-physical forms of violence, can shape youth and adult experiences. Over time, these experiences offered an insider perspective on global institutions’ educational programs and policies about youth. Today, my work continues to be motivated by commitments to social justice and focuses on understanding how young people themselves are leading social movements and otherwise engaged in civic, political, and cultural life.


My dissertation examines the unprecedented rise of youth movements in Brazil and has been supported by ten grants and fellowships including the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad. My work has been published in several journals including Ethnography & Education and is forthcoming in Comparative Education Review.
