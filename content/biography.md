I am a Ph.D. candidate in Education at the University of California, Berkeley. I study youth identity formation and political development; learning and literacies across in-person and digital spaces; and interconnections between local and global structures of oppression and resistance. 

An interdisciplinary social scientist and ethnographer, my research interests are in international and comparative education; the study of education, civic engagement, and social movements; and critical and sociological perspectives of gender, race, class, and place.
